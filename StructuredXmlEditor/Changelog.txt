--------- 1.3.0 ---------

- Add support for giving data files a custom extension, and choosing whether the data should be xml or json.
- Add a ProjectView tool that allows browsing the data files in the project.
- Add support for adding attributes to the xmldef. This is found by checking the 'HasAttributes' attribute on an element.
- Add grouping of entries in the reference dropdown. e.g. Apples,Oranges,Carrots,Cucumber -> Fruit(Apples,Oranges),Vegetables(Carrots,Cucumber).
- Allow for far more complex visibleif bindings. They can now bind to the values of attributes, and also use a path from the current node. e.g. Apples.Name or Parent.Size.
- Collections can now have multiple allowed child types. The one to be spawned can be chosen via the dropdown by the add button.
- Files now display a preview of any linked images. Additionally in the timeline if a keyframe contains a fileimage then it will display a preview of that too.


--------- 1.2.0 ---------

- Fix deleting of the Update executable.
- Make all graph links look like reference ones if FlattenData is used. Also remove the LinkType edit box.
- Slightly alter the padding of the graphnodes to waste less space.
- Add a proper error reporting and feedback system, that sends the data via email.


--------- 1.0.0 ---------

- First major release.
- Add support for loading and saving json.
- Adds support for GraphNodes, and Graph based editing.
- Added ability to generate a rough definition for a xml or json file. This show speed up the creation of definitions for existing data.

- Adds dockable miscellaneous tools:
 -- Add UndoHistory tool that allows viewing and browsing the Undo history.
 -- Add StartPage that shows a fair amount of useful data.
 -- Add FocusTool that allows for easily seeing the data for the selected node in the Graph view.

- Optimised a lot.
- Removed the ability to change the element name dynamically (via ChildAsName or ValueAsName).
- Added support for updating the tool semi-automatically.
